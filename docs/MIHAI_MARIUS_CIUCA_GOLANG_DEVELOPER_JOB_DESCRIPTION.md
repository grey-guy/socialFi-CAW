Golang Blockchain Core Protocol Developer
=========================================

Candidate: Mihai-Marius Ciuca  
Location: Sibiu, Romania  
Current Role: Developer at MultiversX Labs  
Education: Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu (BSc Computer Science, MSc Advanced Computer Science)

Role Objective
--------------
Deliver production-grade Go implementations for blockchain core protocol components and system-level tooling, with a focus on performance, security, and interoperability. This role aligns with Mihai-Marius Ciuca's experience in core protocol development, validator security, cross-chain interoperability, and high-throughput system optimization, and supports ongoing updates to the SocialFi project with reliable backend services and integrations.

Scope of Work
-------------
The Golang developer will lead and contribute to core backend capabilities that enable the SocialFi platform to scale, interoperate with external chains, and provide reliable data pipelines. Work includes protocol services, indexing/streaming integrations, security modules, and operational tooling to support product evolution.

Key Responsibilities
--------------------
- Design and implement Go services that interface with blockchain nodes, indexers, and data streams.
- Build and optimize protocol-level components (consensus, staking, slashing, validator operations).
- Deliver cross-chain interoperability modules (header/checkpoint notarization, proof aggregation).
- Implement security-critical features (guardian workflows, misbehavior proofs).
- Develop high-performance data extraction and transformation tooling (state trie crawling, export pipelines).
- Improve throughput and resource efficiency of transaction pools and processing pipelines.
- Produce clean, tested, and well-documented code with strong observability and operational readiness.

Required Qualifications
-----------------------
- 5+ years of professional software engineering experience with strong Go proficiency.
- Proven background in blockchain node internals, protocol development, or distributed systems.
- Demonstrated expertise in performance tuning, memory optimization, and concurrency.
- Experience producing cryptographic proofs or security-sensitive protocol modules.
- Solid software engineering practices: testing, code review, CI/CD, and production operations.

Preferred Qualifications
------------------------
- Experience in cross-chain or interoperability protocols (bridges, light clients, header notarization).
- Hands-on integration with indexing and analytics platforms (e.g., The Graph, Covalent, Firehose).
- Prior work on staking/validator selection mechanisms and incentive modeling.
- C/C++ background in safety-critical or high-reliability systems.

Relevant Experience Highlights
------------------------------
- Owner and contributor to multiple MultiversX core repositories and protocol sub-components.
- Sovereign shards R&D: interoperable, independently bootstrapped chains with optimized consensus.
- Auction-based staking eligibility and redistributed top-up mechanism.
- Slashing detection with cryptographic proof generation for validator misbehavior.
- Guardian system for protected transaction execution and account recovery.
- 10–15x transaction pool computation improvements and ~50x memory optimization.
- Firehose integration for real-time blockchain data streaming.
- Covalent proxy layer exposing Avro-encoded hyperblocks across a multi-sharded architecture.
- Tooling for data trie crawling, account storage export, and cross-validation.

Project Alignment: SocialFi Update
---------------------------------
This role will support the SocialFi platform by:
- Building Go-based backend services to interface with blockchain data sources and wallets.
- Delivering scalable, verifiable data pipelines for feeds, analytics, and user activity.
- Ensuring protocol-level security and resilience for wallet operations and account safeguards.
- Enabling interoperability with external chains and ecosystems as the product evolves.

Tools and Technologies
----------------------
- Go (primary), C/C++ (secondary)
- Blockchain core protocol development
- Distributed systems, cryptography, and consensus
- Data pipelines and streaming integrations
- Testing frameworks and static analysis tooling

Engagement Details
------------------
- Employment Type: Full-time
- Level: Senior / Principal (based on impact and scope)
- Collaboration: Cross-functional with frontend, product, and DevOps teams
