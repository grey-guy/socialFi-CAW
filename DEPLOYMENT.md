# Deployment Guide

## Environment Variables

Before deploying to Render or any other platform, you need to configure the following environment variables:

### Required Variables

```bash
NETWORK=mainnet
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
CAW_CONTRACT=0x_contract_address
CAW_NAME_CONTRACT=0x_contract_address
CAW_NAME_MINTER_CONTRACT=0x_contract_address
MINTABLE_CAW_CONTRACT=0x_contract_address
```

## Render Deployment

1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your web service
3. Navigate to "Environment" tab
4. Add all the environment variables listed above
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Trigger a new deploy

## Build Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the project
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables
If you see warnings about missing env variables, make sure all required variables are set in your Render environment settings.

### Type Errors
The build process includes TypeScript checking. Fix any type errors before deploying.

### Deprecated Packages
The warnings about deprecated packages (WalletConnect v1, eslint, etc.) are non-critical and won't prevent deployment. Consider upgrading these packages in the future.
